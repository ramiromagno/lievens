`{lievens}` provides Real-Time PCR Data Sets by Lievens et al. (2012).

## Installation

``` r
install.packages("lievens")
```

## Data

Each sample group is defined by the inhibitor ("none", "isopropanol", "tannic
acid"), respective inhibitor concentration, and initial amplicon copy number.
Note that inhibitor concentration and initial copy number of the amplicon
are not independent of each other as concentrations are obtained by
co-dilution.

```{r}
library(lievens)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

lievens |>
  dplyr::distinct(plate, inhibitor, inhibitor_conc, copies, dilution)
```

Here is the number of replicates per group:

```{r}
lievens |>
  dplyr::distinct(plate, inhibitor, inhibitor_conc, copies, dilution, replicate) |>
  dplyr::count(plate, inhibitor, inhibitor_conc, copies, dilution) |>
  print(n = Inf)
```

## Standard dilution series

Most concentrated set of replicates in the dilution series have 100,000 copies
of the soybean Lectin endogene (Le1) derived amplicon. Following samples in the
series are five-fold dilutions.

```{r dpi=300, fig.height=4}
lievens |>
  dplyr::filter(inhibitor == "none") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = cycle, y = fluor, group = interaction(plate, inhibitor, dilution, replicate), col = as.factor(dilution))) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 0.1, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_point(size = 0.05, alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(color = "Fold dilution") +
  ylim(0, 12000)
```

## Inhibition by isopropanol

```{r dpi=300, fig.height=4}
lievens |>
  dplyr::filter(inhibitor == "isopropanol") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = cycle, y = fluor, group = interaction(plate, inhibitor, inhibitor_conc, replicate), col = as.factor(inhibitor_conc))) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 0.1, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_point(size = 0.05, alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(color = "Isopropanol, % (v/v)") +
  ylim(0, 12000)
```

## Inhibition by tannic acid

```{r dpi=300, fig.height=4}
lievens |>
  dplyr::filter(inhibitor == "tannic acid") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = cycle, y = fluor, group = interaction(plate, inhibitor, inhibitor_conc, replicate), col = as.factor(inhibitor_conc))) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 0.1, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_point(size = 0.05, alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(color = "Tannic acid, mg/mL") +
  ylim(0, 12000)
```
